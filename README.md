You understand that by downloading this, you are agreeing not to copy and present this stuff as your own work.

I can put this code up as help, but if you outright copy it for assignments, then I can't do this anymore. :(

To run this, download [Anaconda](http://continuum.io) or some other scientific Python distribution for your OS.
